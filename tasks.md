### Data Structures & Algorithms 




- Search the kth element node.
- Set its parent G's right child to none and go to the parent of G and subtract the weight of k from it.
- Go for successive nodes an


```graphviz
digraph G {
    A -> B
    B -> C
}
```

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
